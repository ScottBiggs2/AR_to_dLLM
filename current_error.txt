ormal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare case
s this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this 
warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
